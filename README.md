# Overview

For this project, the goal was to implement a Red-Black (Binary Search) Tree. The advantage of this data structure is that it automatically rebalances itself so that search functionality can be as close to O(log *n*) as possible.

I wanted to create this project because I wanted to practice pointers and recursion, as well as refreshing my knowledge and understanding of the C++ language.

# Development Environment

This program was written using Visual Studio Code and compiled and run using CLI.

It should run using any recent version of C++ (C++14 and almost certainly earlier versions as well), as I did my best to not use any external libraries. In fact, the only external libraries I used were `cout`, `cin`, and `endl` from the `<iostream>` in the standard library.

# Future Work

- I think the only thing that I could have added that didn't end up having the time for is removal. I did have a very simple implementation of `remove()`, but because it didn't handle rebalancing, so I ended up removing it. I want to implement it in the future.
